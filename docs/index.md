Discover the power of AI with Ask Airy.

Ask Airy revolutionizes your search capabilities, enabling you to intuitively search for records using natural language.

But Ask Airy is more than a search tool — it's your data consultant.
You can ask direct questions about your Airtable data, and Ask Airy will provide insights that previously only a human
could create.

You can even filter the data you want to ask about by view or field.

Ask Airy isn't limited to your Airtable data either. You can ask any question, from "How to use Airtable for inventory
management?"
to "Write me a blog post about how to use Airtable as a CRM solution".
