Discover the power of AI with Ask Airy, an Airtable extension enabling intelligent search and Q&A with your data.
Ask Airy revolutionizes your Airtable search capabilities, enabling you to intuitively search for records using natural
language.

But Ask Airy is more than a search tool — it’s your data consultant. You can ask direct questions about your Airtable
data, and Ask Airy will find and analyze the most relevant records for your question, and respond just as a human data
analyst would!

A [license](https://www.zoftware-solutions.com/l/ask-airy) and an Open AI API Key is required to use the extension.
Free trial is included with license.
