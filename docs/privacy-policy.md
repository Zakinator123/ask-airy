# Ask Airy Privacy Policy

Effective Date: June 6, 2023

## 1. Introduction

Welcome to Ask Airy, an Airtable extension that uses the power of OpenAI's GPT-3.5-turbo API and the OpenAI Embeddings
API to facilitate semantic search and Q&A with the data in your Airtable base.

Your privacy is important to us. We understand that you are trusting us with certain information, and we want to assure
you that we take this responsibility very seriously. This Privacy Policy is designed to help you understand what
information we collect, why we collect it, and how we use and protect it.

## 2. Information We Collect

When you use Ask Airy, we transmit some data (as selected by you) to the OpenAI APIs. However, we do not store any of
your Airtable data.

## 3. Use of Information

The extension uses the transmitted data to provide our services, namely,
enabling semantic search and Q&A with the data in your Airtable base.

## 4. Sharing of Information

We do not share your data with any third parties, except for OpenAI, to provide the extension's services. OpenAI has its
own privacy policy, which states, as of this writing, that: "OpenAI will not use data submitted by customers via our API to train or improve our
models, unless you explicitly decide to share your data with us for this purpose. You can opt-in to share data. Any data
sent through the API will be retained for abuse and misuse monitoring purposes for a maximum of 30 days, after which it
will be deleted (unless otherwise required by law)."

## 5. Security

We prioritize your data's security. Although we do not store any of your Airtable data, we are committed to ensuring the
secure transmission of your data to OpenAI's API. We use a variety of industry-standard technologies and services to
protect your data from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure.

## 6. Changes to Our Privacy Policy

We may occasionally update this Privacy Policy. When we do, we will also revise the "Effective Date" at the top of the
Privacy Policy. We encourage you to periodically review this Privacy Policy to stay informed about how we are protecting
the information we collect.
