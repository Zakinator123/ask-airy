                    <li>Airy cannot create, edit, or delete new records (except for data in the Data Index field).
                    </li>
                    <li>Airy can only analyze a limited number of records at once. The number of records depends on
                        the amount of data in the records.

                    <li>Airy may be able to analyze numerical data in limited sets of records with limited accuracy,
                        but is incapable of conducting numerical data analysis across an entire table.

                    <li>Using large tables with Ask Airy may be slow, especially on slow internet connections.</li>
                    <li>Ask Airy relies on OpenAI APIs under the hood, which can sometimes be flaky.</li>
                    <li>If asked to write airtable scripts or formulas, Airy may produce incorrect syntax.</li>
