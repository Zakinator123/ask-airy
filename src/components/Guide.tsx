                <ul>
                    <li>Using very large tables with Ask Airy may be slow or impossible, especially on slow internet
                        connections.
                    </li>
                    <li>Airy can only analyze a limited number of records at once. The number of records depends on
                        the amount of data in the records.
                    </li>
                    <li>Airy may be able to analyze numerical data in limited sets of records with limited accuracy,
                        but is incapable of conducting numerical data analysis across an entire table.
                    </li>
                    <li>Airy is not a chatbot and will not remember previous questions.</li>
                    <li>Airy cannot create, edit, or delete new records (except for data in the Data Index field).
                    </li>
                    <li>Ask Airy relies on OpenAI APIs under the hood, which can sometimes be flaky.</li>
                    <li>If asked to write airtable scripts or formulas, Airy may produce incorrect syntax.</li>
                </ul>

                    <li>Ask Airy is great for searching and analyzing records in text-heavy tables</li>
                    <li>Use views to filter which records Airy indexes, searches, and analyzes to answer your
                        queries.
                    </li>
                    <li>Add a <Link href='https://support.airtable.com/docs/adding-descriptions-in-airtable'
                                    target='_blank'>description</Link> to your table to give Airy more context about
                        your data.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If Airy&apos;s responses are not satisfactory, experiment with tweaking your queries.
                        Give Airy more context about what you would like it to answer.
